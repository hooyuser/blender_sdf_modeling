# Blender SDF Node Addon
This addon provides **SDF Node System** for **SDF Rendering** and physics simulation with **SDF Collision**. 

SDF refers to signed distance field. You may find lots of impressive content to do with SDF on this website https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm.

For now this addon is still work-in-progress and has no official releases. You can just go for it by manual installation. That is, copy the `sdf_node_addon` directory to your blender's `scripts/addons` directory directly.


## Features
- SDF Rendering
  - Node system which allows real-time viewport update
  - Support combination of primitives, including *Union*, *Subtraction*, *Intersection*, *Blend shape*
  -Support most of the SDF operations listed in 
  - FBM noise displacement
  - Basic PBR rendering
- CPU/GPU Physics Simulation
  - PBD Cloth simulation which allows real-time interaction and caching
  - Analytical SDF collider generated by node system
  - Support backends on different platforms, including CPU, CUDA, OpenGL, Metal
  - Powered by [taichi-blend](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi_blend), a project aiming at intergrating [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) into blender for physics simulation and animation
